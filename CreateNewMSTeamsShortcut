How to create shortcut for new Microsoft Teams

As our dear Microsoft loves changes we/IT admins have to find out new stuff even for basic IT requests. Seeing the glass as half full, I guess Microsoft makes us keep learning, stay with a fresh mind, feel smart,… (!)

If one of your users complains that “There was small Teams picture on my desktop but it has now gone” meaning they would like to have a shortcut on their desktop for Teams app,
unfortunately you now can’t easily find teams.exe in their Program Files to copy the folder path. Because you can’t create shortcuts for pre-installed MS apps or MS Store apps.

But I will tell you how I found Teams app and managed to create a shortcut.

- Press Windows+R
- Run shell:appsfolder and open the folder
- Right click on Microsoft Teams and select “Create shortcut”
- It will ask you the following question where you will say ‘Yes darling I will! I will!’ (Nope, you will say that in a completely different question ;))
"Do you want the shortcut to be placed on the desktop instead?"
