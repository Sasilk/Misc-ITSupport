I am sure you have experienced one or more of your users complain that their calculator suddenly stopped working and/or that they can no longer open pictures in the photos app.
In such cases, as an IT admin, there are several fixes to try but almost all of them are likely to fail.

To save your time, I wanted to share the exact way of fixing MS Store apps.

But need to mention that the following steps have been created by Dan, a friend of mine, who is a great IT engineer. So, I can’t take credit on this (because I know you will thank me as the fixes below works perfectly :)).

Fixing MS Store — Method 1

We need to open PowerShell (PS) as admin and run this command which will re-register Store app.
  Get-AppXPackage WindowsStore -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
Then open PS as the user (not admin) and run this command, which reinstalls it in the user profile and not the admin one.
  wsreset.exe

Fixing MS Store — Method 2

If that fails then
Download this script: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=619547 and extract it.
Run it within the user’s PS (not admin) again
  .\reinstall-preinstalledApps.ps1 Microsoft.WindowsStore

You may have an error if PS is blocking the script from running due to its execution policy settings on user’s device. To allow script execution, run
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
  (To change the execution policy permanently for your user, run: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser)

Then run
  wsreset.exe
