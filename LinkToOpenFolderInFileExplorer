If you get a request from a user that they want to put a link in their email which will open a folder in the shared drive, here the solution;

file://\\FileServerName\PathToFolder\New%20Folder

Note:
Put "file://\\" + enter your file server name + enter file path 
If there are folder names with spaces, basically replace space with %20
